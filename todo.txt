20.11 - 6.12: 
  Reading on Qt, deciding on architecture, general setup
  Added classes Car and CarModelBicyle
  Basic tests
7.12: 
  Added class Simulator for handling of simulation objects
  Added class StateMemory for data logging
  Reading on threads; added threads for classes above
  Testing of rk4 integration of car model: Results look reasonable!
8.12:   
  Added button to start/pause + reset simulation
  Added plotting window + test plot
11.12:
  Testing of data recorder, validation by plotting; fixed minor bugs
  Put plot window in own class, tried to figure out how to replot data (HOW???)
12.12: 
  Implemented QTimer + Signal/Slot mechanism
    [x] time and state seem to diverge!?
17.12:
  Added coordinate transform car--view
  Added basic drawing routine for car

9.1:
  Loading and displaying of bitmaps works now

  Days worked: 11 Left: 14


10.-23.1:
  Egoview, Pathplanner, Controller

todo:

  - create simple udp-server with boost::asio
  - define simple protocol for sending a set of floats
  - create mock-server that generates test data, receive with client
  - setup sim. to listen to data packets (data logger, visualisation)
  - put server classes on RCL hardware, connect with state observer

  asio tutorial: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/boost_asio/tutorial.html
