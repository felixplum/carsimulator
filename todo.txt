20.11 - 6.12: 
  Reading on Qt, deciding on architecture, general setup
  Added classes Car and CarModelBicyle
  Basic tests
7.12: 
  Added class Simulator for handling of simulation objects
  Added class StateMemory for data logging
  Reading on threads; added threads for classes above
  Testing of rk4 integration of car model: Results look reasonable!
8.12:   
  Added button to start/pause + reset simulation
  Added plotting window + test plot
11.12:
  Testing of data recorder, validation by plotting; fixed minor bugs
  Put plot window in own class, tried to figure out how to replot data (HOW???)

Next steps: 

  []Add drawing routine (rectangle)
  []Add draw from StateMemory
  []ReadFromFile (get log output on RCL computer first)
  []Display Gridmap
  []Get coordinate systems right
  []Sample from local map
  []Add controller to car_bicyle_model
  []Add path generator
  []Pass map object to car

) QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM=xxxx. I tried the various 'native', 'raster', 'opengl' settings. On Linux the 'raster' was the best performer. The CPU utilization dropped to about 15% in my test. On windows 'opengl' just caused a blank window screen to appear.... 'raster' was the fastest.
